    """Maximum-likelihood RL (arXiv:2602.02710): the GRPO pipeline with
    mean-normalized advantages — ``(reward − group mean) / group mean`` instead
    of plain centering. Normalizing by the mean instead of the standard
    deviation makes the policy gradient unbiased for the order-``group_size``
    truncation of the maximum-likelihood objective (low-pass-rate examples get
    ~1/p weight; ``group_size`` interpolates REINFORCE at 1 → exact maximum
    likelihood as it grows).

    <= 0 carries no signal and gets zero advantages."""
