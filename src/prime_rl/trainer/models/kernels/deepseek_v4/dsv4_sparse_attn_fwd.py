[DeepSeek V4 Sparse Attention: Forward]

Each query attends to an explicit list of `K` KV positions supplied by the caller, rather than to
a contiguous causal span. This kernel only reads that list; it has no opinion on how the positions
were chosen. Because every query carries a different list, the kernel runs one block per query
position instead of tiling over a block of queries the way dense flash attention does.

Shapes, with the capital of an index letter naming that axis's size:

    Q[b, s, h, d]        (B, S, H, D)   queries, bfloat16
    KV[b, n, g, d]       (B, N, G, D)   keys, bfloat16; V == K here, so one buffer is both
    Indices[b, s, g, k]  (B, S, G, K)   int32 positions into KV's `n` axis
    Sinks[h]             (H,)           float32, one learnable logit per query head
    TileCounts[b, s, g]  (B, S, G)      int32, how many leading slot tiles the query reads
    Output[b, s, h, d]   (B, S, H, D)   bfloat16
    Lse[b, s, h]         (B, S, H)      float32

  - `b`  batch index
  - `s`  query position
  - `n`  KV position
  - `k`  gather slot, one of the `K` a query reads
  - `d`  head dimension
  - `h`  query head index
  - `g`  KV head index, always of size 1; see below

`G` is always 1: every query head reads the same single KV head. The axis survives from the
vendored scaffolding, where `G > 1` would split the `H` query heads into `G` contiguous blocks of
`H / G`, each reading its own KV head. Nothing exercises that path, and the head-padding case
asserts `G == 1` outright, so the equations below fix `g = 0` and drop it. Note that the parameter
is spelled `kv_group` but counts KV heads; the query heads per KV head are `H / G`, spelled
`head_kv`.

`Indices` is listed by its logical shape, but the kernel receives it split into
`n_tiles = K / block_I` tiles of `block_I` slots, as `(B, S, G, n_tiles, block_I)`. `K` is sized for
the most keys any query could need, and a given query will often have fewer. Only `n_tiles` is
symbolic, so one compiled kernel serves every `K`. Declaring `K` itself symbolic instead makes
TileLang bounds-check every slot read against it, a runtime check inside the innermost loop.

[What it computes]

Write `key[b,s,k,d] = KV[b, Indices[b,s,0,k], 0, d]` for the gathered keys. Summing over repeated
indices, and with `scale = D ** -0.5`:

    logit[b,s,h,k]  = scale * Q[b,s,h,d] key[b,s,k,d]
    Z[b,s,h]        = exp(Sinks[h]) + sum_k exp(logit[b,s,h,k])
    p[b,s,h,k]      = exp(logit[b,s,h,k]) / Z[b,s,h]
    Output[b,s,h,d] = p[b,s,h,k] key[b,s,k,d]
    Lse[b,s,h]      = log2(Z[b,s,h])

Note: the sink logit is unscaled; `scale` multiplies the dot products and not `Sinks`. And `Lse`
is a base-2 logarithm of a partition function built from natural exponentials, not `ln Z`; that is
what lets the backward recover `p` as `exp2(logit * log2(e) - Lse)` with a single `exp2`.

The sink contributes to the denominator but owns no key, so `sum_k p[b,s,h,k] < 1` and `Output` is
a shrunken combination of the gathered keys. That is how a head attends to nothing in particular.

[What the caller must guarantee]

`TileCounts[b,s,g]` must cover the query's last valid slot: every slot past its first
`TileCounts * block_I` has to be masked, because the kernel never reads those tiles. A fully masked
tile changes nothing in the online softmax, so skipping one is exact, and a query that reaches
only a few of the `K` slots pays for only those.

Every unused slot must hold a negative index, which is the masking condition:

    Indices[b,s,0,k] < 0 .

This is the only masking the kernel performs. It applies no causality test and never compares
`k` against `s`: whatever the caller means by a valid key is encoded entirely in the index values.
That is also what keeps the kernel correct when `s` is a local index that does not correspond to a
global KV position.

Every other entry must be a real position in `[0, N)`. Nothing checks that: a device-side check
would cost a sync, so an out-of-range index silently corrupts that query's softmax.

[How the loop runs]

The grid is `(query position, batch, KV head)`, so with `G == 1` that is one block per query
position per batch index, holding all `H` query heads of that query at once, or a 64-head chunk
when `H > 64` (`REPLICATE_H`). The block walks its first `TileCounts[b,s,g]` tiles of `block_I`
slots, software-pipelined `num_stages` deep, and per tile:

  1. gather `KV_shared[k,d] = KV[b, Indices[b,s,0,k], 0, d]` into one shared tile of keys
  2. `acc_s[h,k] = Q_shared[h,d] KV_shared[k,d]`, pre-seeded to `-inf` at masked slots
  3. rescale the running max, the denominator and `acc_o` (online softmax)
  4. `acc_o[h,d] += acc_s[h,k] KV_shared[k,d]`, reusing that same tile as values

Step 4 reusing step 1's tile is the `V == K` property: the gather is paid for once and feeds both
GEMMs.

The online softmax is seeded from the sink rather than from an empty sum. `m_i` is carried in raw
dot-product units, so seeding it with `Sinks[h] / scale` makes `m_i * scale * log2(e)` equal
`Sinks[h] * log2(e)`, and seeding `sumexp` to `1` is exactly that term's own exponential relative
to that max. `T.reduce_max(..., clear=False)` then keeps the sink as a floor on the running max. A
query whose slots are all masked therefore emits `Output = 0` and a finite
`Lse = Sinks[h] * log2(e)`, where a zero-seeded denominator would divide by zero.

The TileLang scaffolding is vendored from tile-ai/tilelang (Apache 2.0) and modified for dynamic
shapes. The attention itself differs from tilelang's sparse MLA: there is no score-only channel
tail (every channel feeds both the score and the output), and the per-head learnable sink logit is
folded into the online softmax as described above.
